            Please use the file dropdown menu to open a project, then the comboBox to open the existing project "test". FYI, Everything in the Main Tree on the right-hand side is "right-click" context menu driven. Mapping in procedures is "drag and drop" and also uses "right-click" context menus. Collapse and restore panels with the small arrows in the title blocks of each. All panels can be resized at the borders. Enjoy! <i style="color:Red">dHTMLx package does not work well in Firefox!</i>
